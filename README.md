# PhoA-AutoSplitter
LiveSplit AutoSplitter for Phoenotopia: Awakening

By default uses the same splits as WR (by astrohill, at the time of writing), but you can choose which things you split on based on various 
- Tools and Upgrades
- Miscellaneous Flags
- Locations

Feel free to @Gyoshi on the Discord [Phoenotopia Fan Server](https://discord.gg/Swd6zcTCQZ) for whatever

## Known Issues
- **Does not work if you launch the game after the autosplitter is loaded**
    - This is a big one, and I hope to fix it soon
- Haven't found a trigger for the final split
- Would like a start trigger too (difficulty select)
