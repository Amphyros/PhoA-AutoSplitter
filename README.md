# PhoA-AutoSplitter
LiveSplit AutoSplitter for Phoenotopia: Awakening

Can automatically start and split the timer. By default uses the same splits as astrohill's Any% WR (at the time of writing), but you can choose which things you want to split on based on various 
- Tools and Upgrades
- Miscellaneous Flags
- Locations

Also calculates in-game time, which does not include 
- Time spent loading
- Time spent paused in the options or inventory menus

Feel free to @Gyoshi on the Discord [Phoenotopia Fan Server](https://discord.gg/Swd6zcTCQZ) for whatever

## Known Issues
- ~~Does not work if you launch the game after the autosplitter is loaded~~
    - I've applied a work-around, but let me know if you have trouble with this
- Only tested on version 1.3.3 of the game
